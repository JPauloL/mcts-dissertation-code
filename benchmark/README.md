### Graph Coloring Instances

All graph instances are part of the DIMACS benchmark. For the instances that don't have exact solutions, the instance is annotated with the best known upper bound. 

The heuristic algorithms are run in parallel, while the mcts algorithms are run sequentially to be able to assess the advantages of the parallelization of the search.
